# TreatmentFlow

TreatmentFlow is an AI-based project for optimizing the flow of patients through the emergency room.
It includes 3 major components:
- Deep Learning-based patient priority assignment through an automated triage system
- Constraint Optimization-based hospital bed assignment based on incoming patients and available resources
- Bayesian Network-based diagnostic tools to produce bedside documents for doctors only, which display the probabilities of certain conditions based on symptom inputs

TreatmentFlow was originally created by Adam Neto and Emese Elkind during the months of February-April 2025 as a project for their third-year Queen's University School of Computing course: CISC 352 - Artificial Intelligence.
