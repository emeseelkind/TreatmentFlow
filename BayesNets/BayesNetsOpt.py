Step 4: Bayesian optimization to tune model parameters:
Uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to model the probability distribution over possible parameter values.
Chooses the next best parameters to evaluate based on an acquisition function like Expected Improvement (EI).

Step 5: Generate a Bedside Report
After computing the top diagnoses with probabilities, generate a doctors-only summary.
The output can be:

Patient Condition Probability Table:
------------------------------------
1. Pneumonia - 85%
2. COVID-19 - 78%
3. Flu - 65%
